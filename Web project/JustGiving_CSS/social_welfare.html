                Homelessness is an issue that affects many communities around the world, large and
                small. Charities have been working to help combat homelessness, and improve social
                welfare conditions, for people at home and abroad.
            </li><br>
            <li>Children face many challenges in the modern world, and many have to deal with
                chronic shortages of food, shelter and healthcare, sadly.If you would like to help
                you could donate directly to or start a fundraising page to support a charity that
                aims to help children and young people.</li><br>
            <li>Charities who work on behalf of the disabled have long been campaigning to improve
                the quality of life, and the rights of those living with disabilities.</li><br>
            <li>In the event of an international disaster or emergency charities or often the best
                placed to help on the ground, distributing aid and supplies to help the recovery
                effort.</li><br>
            <li>Charities are uniquely placed to help improve healthcare around the world in a
                number of ways: they can respond to epidemics and disasters by getting doctors on
                the ground, assist with supplying medicines to impoverished areas, and raise money
                for life-saving research that otherwise would not be possible.</li>
